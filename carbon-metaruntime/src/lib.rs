The metaruntime tracks the following:
    - Component definitions, esp. a main component
        - a unique string `ID` (name) for the component, which becomes its fs location
          and the way it's imported/referenced.  Forward slashes may be supportable for
          nesting into directories, but we need to figure out how to resolve ambiguity
          (e.g. `Main` and `some-directory/Main`)

          Perhaps `foo::Bar`, namespace syntax?

          this needs to play nicely with Rust's import system, which will be the backbone
          for the actual import functionality. we should spot-check compatibility with ES/TS
          imports for a future web runtime.

        - a `Template`  for that component, describing a tree of its contained elements
        - `Properties` for that component's contained elements
            - a semantized object (properties coproduct) describing all properties,
              with pointers to the Expression LUT as needed
        - `Actions` for that component (or just a string representing the contents of the code-behind file)
        - An `Expression` table, really just a hashmap of `unique-id` => `function` (or just a Vec<fn>)
            - Double-check:  does this table belong in the runtime or metaruntime?  Is it needed
              in stand-alone runtime?

How do we compile our actions and code-behind files?
    - Generate into a temp directory?
    - pipe the content into rustc?
    - perhaps these don't get fired by the metaruntime (akin to Flash/HA's edit vs. preview modes) â€”
        that is, don't deal with actions at all in the metaruntime until compiling to RIL
    - perhaps the whole project is recompiled, and the metaruntime re-attaches itself

How does the metaruntime bolt onto an engine instance (+ chassis) to enable it to
"take over" the render tree definition?

/*
We need a patchable properties object

Does `transform` and `size` go into properties or are they special?
What about `id`?

By putting as much as possible into the properties object (e.g. including transform and size),
we make it easier to DRY the `compute_in_place` logic, and to enable fine-grained control of
which elements expose size/transform vs. those for which those properties are irrelevant

What will it look like to set size?

```
//expose a trait method
my_dyn_rendernode.set_size(some_size2d)
//internally, wraps this value into a property coproduct patch, applies it
```
